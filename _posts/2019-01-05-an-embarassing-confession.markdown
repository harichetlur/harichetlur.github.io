A happy 2019 to anyone bothering to read this. It's not like I have been regular in writing any blog posts here. For the past 6 months or so, I have been neck-deep in IRL stuff. I've recently switched locations in my job, changed teams, moved to a new house, et al. So, I hope all is forgiven and forgotten if you had been eagerly awaiting my next post. Needless to say, my resolution this year is to post here more often.

I spent new years' eve making vacation plans with my wife. Our joint resolution is to travel more this year, so we stayed up at night figuring out which holidays we plan to use in the year, and what places we intend to visit. I kept myself busy with marking dates on my calendar, while my wife browsed the internet looking for inspirations for places we could visit.

If you are one of the folks who have been in this situation, you'd know, browsing the internet for ideas or the 'best of something' is just a death trap to land on listicles. Sure enough, it took my wife about 2 clicks to land on a link that said 'Top ten vacations for 2019'. As she browsed through it, she wondered aloud, "I wonder how these travel advisors narrow it down for 2019. It's not even begun yet, so it's not like they have visited these places in 2019. But how do they know these places would be amazing?"

"Easy." I replied. "They don't."

"Don't what?"

"They don't know if they would be amazing. They probably have no idea at all what the place is like."

"That's rubbish. How do you know?"

"I was one of them."

And that was the confession I began the new year with. I am not proud of this phase of life.

I was a student who would take any kind of money that would come my way. I was also the student editor of my college magazine. A few weeks into my stint as editor, I received emails from a conglomerate of writers that offered me gig for a moderate amount of money. I involved editing text for local magazines. I saw no harm in this, and soon I was proof-reading school brochures, event pamphlets, posters for gigs and the whole lot. Every couple of weeks, I would be handed a cheque for my efforts. It was not much, but it paid for the occasional gadget, guitar accessory or online subscription.

The handing-over-a-cheque was done by this guy on a motorcycle who would show up outside my college every other week. One day as he handed over the sum for my efforts, he asked "Do you only edit, or do you even write?" I replied that I did the latter as well.

"In that case, you can make more money than you are doing now."

I looked down at the cheque and shrugged. I wouldn't mind a bit more money for my time. I hated editing anyway. Most of the time I had to rewrite some truly terrible english. "Sure, I can take a look." I said aloud.

The lad promised to get back to me at the earliest. Sure enough, the very next day, he called me up and said he'd got me a new gig. He wanted me to write an 800 word piece on Akbar's childhood. This was for a website, he told me.

"Akbar?" I asked, not sure if I had heard him correctly.

"Yes. Emperor Akbar." he replied confidently.

"But I know nothing about Akbar's life."

"You have access to the internet, right?"

"You want me to read something off the internet and write it again to be put back on the internet?"

"Yes. Make sure you write it in your own words though."

This did not make sense to me, but I thought I'd try it anyway. He had promised more money after all. So I stayed up all night, went through some links on the internet and spewed out an 800-worder. I emailed it to him the next morning.

The guy called me up at lunch and he couldn't control himself. "This is amazing. And so fast!" I told him it wasn't difficult at all. Everything was already on the internet anyway.

A week later, I was contacted again. This time, he said, he had a gig for me that would surely blow my mind. Listicles. I was addicted to this easy money so I took up the offer. Over the next 3 weeks or so, I churned out lists after lists, of things ranging from top 10 sports cars (I had never driven a car in my life) to the top European homestays (I had never been to Europe) and the best spots in New York to take someone on a date (I had never been to New York and never been on a date).

The results of these efforts amazed me. I received nearly ten times the money I used to get for editing a brochure! 'Listicles', the guy informed me, 'are the new gold mine of the internet. Everyone clicks on them and we get paid by the click. All we need to do is find the trending search, and publish a listicles on it.'

This gig went on for about 3 months. I bought myself new clothes, subscribed to and played World of Warcraft and ate out a lot. Until, one day, the guy disappeared without a trace. My only method of contacting him was his phone number and that went dead. When I emailed the original id, I was offered editing gigs again. I no longer wanted those.

Just like that my gig as a freelance Listicle writer came to an end, and I got back to studying at college like I was supposed to.
